Olá e bem vindo! Meu nome é Gabriel, e eu sou um Desenvolvedor Web.
Esse repositório contém alguns de meus projetos.

Hello there and welcome! My name is Gabriel, and I am a Web Developer.

Currently, I'm a freshman at University, and what better way of wasting away my year than learning how to code? As I think it should be a natural evolution on the learning path of to code, I'm taking a look at Git. This is my first real experience with Git and Github besides the ocasional download or anything so I'm actually really excited about learning all of the "inner workings".

Besides Git and Github, I am currently learning how to Web Develop, with HTML, CSS and all the magic of Js and Python
