# Number Guesser
##   In this project
my goal is to create a simple game of number guessing, where the terminal will choose randomly a number
between 1 and 100 and the player will have to guess correctly. For each wrong guess, there is a tip. Maybe a bigger or smaller number, or even if it is a multiple to some other number.
